# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-System
This project leverages deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze facial expressions in real-time, categorizing them into one of seven distinct emotional states (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The neural network is trained on the FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) dataset. It consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.
